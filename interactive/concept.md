### How does your country define national urban policy? 
The UN habitat, is a branch of the UN that focuses on helping nations develop comprehensive urban policies and practices. On their website, they have 
a map that they refer to as the Urban Policy Database. It's less of a database and more of an interactive map that when you click on the countries, 
a pop-out lists information about that country's national urban policy definition. I thought it would be fun idea to take all of the definitions and do a 
drop down viewing sort of thing so people can read through them without the interface of a map. My visual is below. 


### Historic Redlining and Current Community Development Block Grant Spending in NYC
The UN Habitat database map listed the community development block grant as having the definiton of the US national urban policy. I'd like to use this 
information to assess how the allocation to NYC benefits neighborhoods that have been historically redlined (or does not benefit). The UN Habitat helps 
countries identify various methods to ensure Cities are going to be affordable and livable as they inevitably grow. Redlining was a historic practice that 
in the US that lead to decades of wealth depletion in Black communities by reserving wealth from the housing market to white buyers. (this description will
be better......) I'll use data from CDBG spending over the years and overlay that with historic redlining. Redlining map will remain static, and the user 
will select years from a drop down to display an overlay of CDBG spending. 



### Something with Public Housing Spending and Prosperity
The pervasive narrative is private investment will lead to prosperity. However, that narrative is harmful for anyone without millions of dollars and the 
the ability to invest heavily in exploitative markets. I would like to utilize historic data about national investment in public housing and use that 
to show the UN that promoting public housing investment is GOOD!!! Maybe use the image of a house? Not sure.
