# Hand Drawn Sketches of the Data and What We Would Like to Visualize
Visualization 1
<p>This visualization uses data from the Gender Equality goal #5. One of the first achievement indicators is how much progress countries have made in implementing legal frameworks to protect and enforce gender equity in employment and economic benefit. The only question I'm guided by here is to the broad adventure of figuring out the progress countries have made. There seems to be a limited set of data to 2019/18 and 2020. SO it's more of snap shot than a historical account, but I don't think that's a bad thing. There are plenty of countries included in the analysis to see a fair global picture of current affairs. The data used here isn't abundantly clear, but I assume it's based on the data collected in other areas qualitative research and policy making analysis. I want to use a map to visualize this data. But instead of using colors on the countries to show the area, I would like to focus on the percent more precisely by showing an icon. This icon will be a portion of a pie, with 100% being the full pie. I feel like this is straight forward, and could give the reader the data on a global scale. </p>

Visualization 2
<p>This visualization aims to compare the percentage of women in congress/governmental elected positions and the percent of reproductive rights access. As both of these variables are shown as percentages, I thought it would be fun to put them both onto a map and make a bivariate choropleth representation. This would include plotting both pieces of information, and then laying them on top of one another so the colors combine to show both pieces of data at once. The data here seems to be robust, incomplete in some areas, but i believe there's enough overlap to get something moving. If possible, I think it would be interesting to include other reproductive rights variables, as I want to explore the relationship/influence of women in government seats and access to sexual health variables. They say that more women in government can lead to better outcomes for future generations of women. Is that the current trend? </p>

Visualization 3 
<p>This visualization takes the same info from the first visualization about achievement in legal frameworks, but includes the proportion of women in managerial positions. I think this could show to the progress that countries are making in how well they're walking the walk so to say. I think another map would be useful to visualize the achievement percentage, but instead of portions of a pie, it could be a fun challenge to try and relate the percent to an area shaded by country. This could be tricky for countries that have a smaller land area value, but I still think it's worth exploring. Then in little data multiples at the bottom below the map, would be the data on managerial positions. The data for this variable is more incomplete, so I thought it would be helpful to aggregate some of it, and show it based on larger region, or just feature a few country profiles. This could help expand my use of global vs individualized data. </p>
