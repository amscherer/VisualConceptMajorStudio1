        <h1>Women in the Economy</h1>
            <p>Alix Scherer | Major Studio 1</p>
            <p>In 2015 the United Nations (UN) put together a list of 17 goals that in their pursuit, would create a better and more just world. Goal 5, Gender Equality, has a success measure for whether or not countries have implemented frameworks to promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. This map series takes a look at whether or not the implementation of such frameworks has an impact on the number of women in managerial positions or the number of women that are unemployed over the age of 25.</p>

            <p>In order to better visualize the effectiveness of such framework implementations, the bottom two maps feature an overlay of the outcomes ontop of the frameworks map.  These maps also help in identifying which countries are not using their implemented frameworks of enforcement to achieve greater gender equality.</p>
